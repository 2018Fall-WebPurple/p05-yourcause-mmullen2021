  <h2>About Sea Turtles:</h2>  
   <p><figure><img id="TurtleColorfulShell" src="TurtleColorfulShell.jpg" alt="Sea Turtle back" title="Sea Turtle."/></figure> Today, there are seven species of sea turtles that call earth home. The Loggerhead, Green, Leatherback, Hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, Olive ridley, and Flatback turtles have existed for around 110 million years. This makes them one of the most ancient creatures on earth. Sea Turtle colors vary between greens, yellows, and blacks; depending on the species. Their diet mostly consists of crabs, shrimp, snails, algae, and jellyfish. Sea turtles can be found in all warm and temperate waters throughout the world and often migrate between different feeding grounds and beaches. They also spend most of their lives in the water and will often return to the same nesting grounds at which they were born.</p>

    <h2>Threats:</h2>
     <p>Unfortunately, nearly all sea turtle species are currently endangered. Only about 1 in 1,000 baby sea turtles will make it to adulthood. Some of the biggest threats to sea turtles are oil spills, illegal hunting, entanglement in ocean debris such as plastic bags, and habitat loss caused by human development.
     Many turtles are also affected by artificial lights used by communities. Turtles who normally follow the moon and starsâ€™ reflection off the waves to make it back to water can get confused by these lights and be more vunerable to predators and dehydration.</p>

     <h2>How to Help:</h2>
     <p>Thankfully, if we work together we can help to save the sea turtles from harm and endangerment. To help we can support sea turtle conservation by getting involved. We can acheive this by reducing marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles. We can also participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and oceans clean. Other great ways to help are by not disturbing nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings and by filling in holes and by knocking down sandcastles before you leave the beach because  they can become obstacles for nesting turtles or emerging hatchlings.</p>
